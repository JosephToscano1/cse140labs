# Please provide your answers as integers (don't use quotes)
# To find the row you want to add the value to, please refer
# to the delay table, and under "TOML Code", find the value
# stored. The value before the period should correspond to
# a value in between square brackets. For example, d1.a
# corresponds to the line below.

# For the first two tables, provide one integer, for the
# remaining tables, provide an array of 2 integers.

# For more info on TOML syntax, please refer to:
# https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0
